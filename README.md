# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Description

The Handwritten Digit Recognition System is a deep learning-based application designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits with high accuracy. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process image data, providing a robust solution for digit recognition tasks. This system is especially useful in applications such as automated form processing, educational tools, and digitized data entry.

The system is trained on the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset of handwritten digits, and can also make predictions on external images of digits provided by users. It delivers accurate and efficient digit classification by leveraging the power of deep learning.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * The system normalizes pixel values and reshapes the input images to prepare them for training and inference.
   * Supports external images by preprocessing them (resizing, normalizing, and reshaping) to match the model's input format.

2. **Deep Learning Model:**

   * Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
   * Includes layers for convolution, pooling, and dense operations optimized for image data.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**

   * Trained on the MNIST dataset with a split for validation to monitor performance.
   * Evaluates the model's accuracy using test data.

4. **Digit Prediction:**

   * Allows users to upload external images of handwritten digits.
   * Provides predictions with a clear visualization of the input image and the predicted digit.

5. **User-Friendly Interface:**

   * Uses Python scripts and Matplotlib for displaying predictions and enhancing user interaction.


## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language for model development, data preprocessing, and prediction.
* **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.
* **NumPy:** Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** Visualization library used for displaying images and predictions.
* **OpenCV:** Library for image processing and handling external input images.


## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kazoli11/Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-using-Deep-Learning-for-smarter-AI-application
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
